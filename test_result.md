# Test Results - RankdSEO Admin Panel Implementation

## Testing Protocol
- Backend testing must be done first using `deep_testing_backend_nextjs`
- Frontend testing should only be done with explicit user permission
- Never invoke `deep_testing_frontend_nextjs` without user approval
- Always update this file before invoking testing agents
- Never fix issues already fixed by testing agents

## Original User Problem Statement
Build an admin panel for RankdSEO that allows admin users to:
- Create and manage backlink opportunities
- Edit opportunity details (title, URL, difficulty, etc.)
- Manage step-by-step tutorial instructions for each opportunity
- Delete opportunities

**Latest Enhancement Request:**
Add email search filter to the Admin User Management page with the following requirements:
- Search by both user name AND email
- Case-insensitive search
- Beautiful search input placed where "All Users" heading is
- Placeholder text: "Search by user/email"

## Current Implementation Status
**Phase**: User Search Filter Feature - Ready for Backend Testing
**Date**: Current session (Email Search Filter Enhancement)

### Backend Implementation
- Status: **COMPLETED**
- Completed Tasks:
  ✅ Created admin tRPC router (`/app/lib/api/routers/admin.ts`)
  ✅ Added adminProcedure authorization (already existed in trpc.ts)
  ✅ Implemented opportunity CRUD procedures (list, get, create, update, delete)
  ✅ Implemented instruction CRUD procedures (create, update, delete, reorder)
  ✅ Added getStats procedure for admin dashboard
  ✅ Integrated admin router into app router (`/app/lib/api/root.ts`)

### Frontend Implementation
- Status: **COMPLETED**
- Completed Tasks:
  ✅ Created `/admin` main page with:
    - Statistics dashboard (opportunities, users, projects, instructions)
    - Search and filter functionality
    - List of all opportunities with edit/delete actions
    - Add new opportunity button
  ✅ Created `/admin/opportunities/new` page with:
    - Comprehensive form for creating opportunities
    - All fields including SEO metrics, pricing, difficulty
  ✅ Created `/admin/opportunities/[id]/edit` page with:
    - Form to edit opportunity details
    - Section to manage tutorial instructions
    - Add, edit, delete instruction steps
    - Preview link to view as user would see it
  ✅ Added admin menu item to sidebar (visible only to ADMIN role users)

## Test Results

### Backend Testing Results (Completed)

**Database Setup**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
- PostgreSQL database installed and configured
- Database schema created with Prisma migrations
- Admin user seeded successfully (admin@rankseo.com / Admin123!)
- 21 backlink opportunities with instructions seeded

**Frontend Authentication**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL  
- Admin login works correctly through the web interface
- User can access dashboard and admin panel pages
- Session cookies are properly set
- Admin role verification works in the frontend

**Backend API Authentication**: ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE
- tRPC context is not properly extracting session from requests
- All admin API endpoints return 401 "Not authenticated" errors
- The `auth()` function in tRPC context is not receiving request context
- This prevents all admin CRUD operations from working

**Admin API Endpoints Status**:
- ❌ admin.getStats - 401 Unauthorized
- ❌ admin.listOpportunities - 401 Unauthorized  
- ❌ admin.createOpportunity - 401 Unauthorized
- ❌ admin.getOpportunity - Not tested (depends on auth)
- ❌ admin.updateOpportunity - Not tested (depends on auth)
- ❌ admin.deleteOpportunity - Not tested (depends on auth)
- ❌ admin.createInstruction - Not tested (depends on auth)
- ❌ admin.updateInstruction - Not tested (depends on auth)
- ❌ admin.deleteInstruction - Not tested (depends on auth)

**Root Cause**: The tRPC `createContext` function is not properly configured to extract the NextAuth session from incoming requests. The `auth()` function needs access to the request headers/cookies to validate the session.

## Testing Details

### Backend API Endpoints to Test:
1. **Admin Stats**: `admin.getStats` - Get dashboard statistics
2. **List Opportunities**: `admin.listOpportunities` - List all opportunities with search/filter
3. **Get Opportunity**: `admin.getOpportunity` - Get single opportunity with instructions
4. **Create Opportunity**: `admin.createOpportunity` - Create new opportunity
5. **Update Opportunity**: `admin.updateOpportunity` - Update existing opportunity
6. **Delete Opportunity**: `admin.deleteOpportunity` - Delete opportunity
7. **Create Instruction**: `admin.createInstruction` - Add instruction step
8. **Update Instruction**: `admin.updateInstruction` - Edit instruction step
9. **Delete Instruction**: `admin.deleteInstruction` - Delete instruction step

### Authentication:
- Admin user: `admin@rankseo.com` / `admin123`
- All admin endpoints should reject non-admin users
- Should return FORBIDDEN error for regular users
